# Terminal Chat App Plan with Gorilla WebSocket and Bubble Tea

## Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment

### 1.1 Install Go

- Download and install Go from the official website.
- Verify the installation by checking the version in your terminal.

### 1.2 Install Dependencies

- Install Gorilla WebSocket package using Go's package manager.
- Install Bubble Tea package using the same package manager.

### 1.3 Setup Project Structure

- Create a directory for your project.
- Inside the project directory, create subdirectories for models, views, and handlers.

## Step 2: Implement WebSocket Handling

### 2.1 Create WebSocket Handler

- Define a function to establish a WebSocket connection.
- Define functions to handle reading messages from and writing messages to the WebSocket.

### 2.2 Implement Connection Logic

- Implement logic to initiate a WebSocket connection to a server.
- Include error handling and reconnection logic.

## Step 3: Design Data Models

### 3.1 Define User Model

- Create a struct to store user details such as username and ID.

### 3.2 Define Message Model

- Create a struct to store chat messages, including sender information, content, and timestamp.

## Step 4: Set Up Bubble Tea for UI

### 4.1 Initialize Bubble Tea Model

- Define the initial state of your Bubble Tea model, including fields for the chat messages and user input.

### 4.2 Create Bubble Tea Views

- Design views for displaying chat messages and input fields.
- Ensure the views update dynamically based on user interaction and incoming messages.

## Step 5: Handle User Input

### 5.1 Capture User Input

- Implement logic to capture user input from the terminal.

### 5.2 Process User Commands

- Parse and handle user commands, such as sending a message or quitting the app.

## Step 6: Manage Message Flow

### 6.1 Send Messages

- Implement logic to send messages to the WebSocket server when the user submits input.

### 6.2 Receive Messages

- Implement logic to handle incoming messages from the WebSocket server and update the chat view.

## Step 7: Integrate Components

### 7.1 Combine WebSocket and UI

- Integrate WebSocket handling with the Bubble Tea UI to ensure seamless communication.

### 7.2 Ensure Synchronization

- Ensure that the message flow between the WebSocket and the UI is synchronized, with messages appearing in the chat view in real-time.

## Step 8: Test and Debug

### 8.1 Unit Testing

- Write unit tests for individual components, such as WebSocket handling and user input processing.

### 8.2 Integration Testing

- Test the integration of all components to ensure they work together smoothly.

### 8.3 Debugging

- Debug any issues that arise during testing and ensure the app runs smoothly.

## Step 9: Deployment

### 9.1 Package the App

- Package your Go application for distribution.

### 9.2 Deploy the App

- Deploy your application to a server or distribute it to users.

## Step 10: Maintenance and Updates

### 10.1 Monitor the App

- Monitor the application for any issues and user feedback.

### 10.2 Implement Updates

- Make necessary updates and improvements based on feedback and new requirements.
